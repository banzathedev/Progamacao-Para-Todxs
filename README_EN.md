                                                                                        - Local: http://localhost:8081/
                                                                                        - Network: http://192.168.0.19:8081/"
Copy the sentence in front of "local:" and paste it into your browser, the site will be loaded and everything will be ready for you use the site.
p.s: localhost ports can change according to availability so I suggest copying and pasting instead of typing.
